## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle AirBnB data from 2016 to better understand:

1. What are the busiest times to visit Seattle?
2. How do the prices spike over the year
3. Is there a neighbourhood that is most famous according to location reviews and is that reflected in the price?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by AirBnB, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
